            </h3>
            <p> Other user experiences at a deeper level.
            This was a discord project deigned using python and a ZenQuote API 
            with urban dictionary level understanding  that helped in giving feeback for user
            as well as increase interaction in a discord server. Additionally it uses 
            sentiment analysis to process messages, so if the users are not being nice 
            to one another, it will handle those negative comments and may automatically report 
            certain users.

            <h3>Vision Shower Detection</h3>
            <p>This project was done in TAMUHACK as a hardware project.
                As a computer engineer, it is not only important for me to 
                emphasize the software development part of my website but also
                a hardware one as well. This project programmed using python and
                implemented a camera functionality using Arduino IDE. Essentially this 
                project allows users to detect themeselves with the light turning green
                on the breadboard or a light turning red if irregularities are found.

            <h2>Health App</h2>
            <p>This was my second CS project I did with a group of software
            engineers. Essentially, we wanted to create an app that records
            the number of calories a person has consumed. Additionally, we 
            wanted to break those calories into carbohydrates, fats, and 
            proteins to guage what was needed for a balance diet. There was also
            an implemented toolbox that gave you substituted options if necessary
            to balance out your dietary needs. The substituted options are AI generated, 
            and give you variety of food options.

            <h3>NFL Fantasy handler</h3>
            <p>This a project I am currently working on, and it is really based 
                on the finetuning data portion of my internship where I learned to
                handle large data. Essentially the idea of the project was to fine tune
                large advance stats so that users can see an organized, reasonable assertions 
                of certain nfl players fantasy plays that help predict future fantasy points.
                I am also currently working with a software engineering team in which we make 
                an app that showcases every stat possibile in an user-frienly way.
