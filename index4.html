                <h3>Priro Systems Intern </h3>
                <p>For the first part of this internship, it was essential that
                    we built a greater understanding about AWS. This included doing a 
                    course on the AWS cloud practitioner essentials. We then practice dealing
                    with NLP queries in the SaaS platform that was hosted by AWS. Subesequently, 
                    we were placed in teams that dealth with those nlp queries for the purpose
                    of reducing errors in certain AI models(can't be named). Lastly, we then played around
                    with data for the purposes of fine-tuning large models and data. The link to the company
                    website is at the bottom of the page.

            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>When it comes to my classes at TAMU, I mostly use C++. It's 
                where I do most of my projects. From learning the basic for loop to
                data structures and algorithms, C++ has guieded me in learning the 
                foundations of coding.Likewise, python has done the same. 
                Whenever I've done small projects during my undergrad, I usually stick
                with python as it helps me keep everything simple and easy to use. 
                I also often have made mistakes when I have done small projects early in
                my undergrad, but using python has helped me identifying mistakes faster 
                even when I was just beginning to code. I would also say that whenever I am 
                doing coding interviews, python is far superior in my eyes because of its vast
                usability from its library for solving problems.

            <h3> Qualification 3(AI/ML) </h3>
            <p>In my last internship, I learned to use AI and even fine tune with AI for
                experience that I can use in my current project. When it comes to 
                different models of AI other than GPT, whether its' the falcon model or
                the llama 2 model, the leaderboard for the fastest AI model is changing.
                I've also kept in mind that these models are not perfect and have many issues
                that has kept me interested. To address these issues, usually we have these 
                models work with large data. This is where I took inspiration from to work 
                on my current project that deals with nfl players data. The inspiration was taken 
                the Llama 2 model linked below this page.
