            <p>Howdy! My name is Sandeep Mishra, and I am a junior Computer engineering student at 
                Texas A&M. This website is meant to invoke my values as a computer science student and my journey  
                as an undergrad so far. But in order to talk about my values, I would like to talk about 
                my first failure in this joruney. As we all know, failure is the pillar
                of success and when I did my first software engineering project with a team, I learned
                a whole lot. The app is called H4U, which was done in my TACS club linked below this page, 
                and was essentially supposed to be a fitness related app that went
                along with the health app(coming up in the next page!). The app tracks how many calories
                you lost or gained using a database API. Howevever, our team couldn't 
                fullfill or manage the data generated as we were not consistent with
                normalizing data and optimizing and scaling indices. This resulted
                into poor user experience. Even though we didn't achieve what we wanted 
                for this app, I learned a lot of great software engineering team lessons: planning, communicating, 
                adapting.

            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>This was argubly the most important step as a software 
            engineer. The mistake my team made, was that we swifty planned our
            app development. What we learned is that if we had more meetings 
            about what we needed to address and lay out the foundations for , 
            we would have been better off at knowing the risks and responsibilities
            of using the database api that managed our project.

            <h3>Communicating</h3>
            <p>As we became more frustated by the fact that our project was 
                not to where we wanted, some of our teammates became less 
                communicative. However, we understood in later projects too that 
                even if we hit a wall, we should talk about the shortcomings and 
                what we can do to address it. We later decided that for H4U, we
                would backtrack to where things worked and work on the health app instead.
                This was a major key in helping us at least have the right mindset for a
                better plan for another project.

            <h3>Adapting</h3>
            <p>When we were working on H4U, there were many moments where
                we were managing scalability, but we were finding it 
                quite challenging. In these moments, it is very hard to know whether 
                to keep working on the issues or backtrack and find a different way to manage
                all the data. Looking back at the project, I could point to ways we at least 
                attempted to adapt, whihc really helped when dealing with future
                projects that is in the techincal portfolio coming up!
