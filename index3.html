                <h3>SmartMathTutor</h3>
                <p> This was my first official job/service outside of working with
                    computing. Essentially, I was volunteering to help out 
                    middle and high schoolers with different math backgrounds
                    that range from Pre calculcus to calculcus. This also extended
                    with me helping students with CBE exams, competetions, etc. It also
                    allowed me to gain experience in online teaching. The links to 
                    the website as well as the personal whizdom tutoring page where 
                    you can request me as a tutor is linked in the bottom of this page.

                <p> 
                    In Dallas, I would frequently volunteer at Feed My starving Children, hosted by 
                    my local neighborhood. I help packed food such as rice,soy, and nutritionally 
                    blended vitamins to help prevent malnutrition for less-developed countries.
                    In there, I was part of two divisions: Warehouse and Food. In the Warehouse division,
                    this is where I did most of the heavy lifting for food boxes to be carried out 
                    in other warehouses. Lastly in the food division, I help controlled a multi-staged process 
                    of putting food insided bags, weighing them, and stamping them for approval to be taken.
